Hey there. My name is Jimmy. I grew up in the suburbs outside of Los Angeles on originally Tongva land, just below the foothills of what we now call the San Gabriel mountains.

After studying functional linguistics in Oregon, I moved to West Africa for most of my twenties. There, I taught primary and secondary school in northern Sierra Leone with the Peace Corps and at an international school in Nouakchott, Mauritania.

These days, I work for a podcast hosting and analytics provider, explore my adopted home (sometimes in a camper van), and try to read and write in my spare time.

### More Information

Home is in the middle of the **Ribeira Sacra e Serras do Oribio e Courel Biosphere Reserve (about the size of Yosemite National Park) in Galicia, Spain, with 75,000 neighbors along with 1,200 species of flora and 277 species of fauna.

I eat vegetarian, overuse commas, and support the reorganization of society that prioritizes the planet and its inhabitants over the accumulation and consolidation of capital.

The title of this blog and expression _among the stones_ is the translated Loko toponym of my host village in Sierra Leone. It’s also apt in Galicia. Among the Stones is about a few things:

- [journal](https://amongthestones.com/journal/) updates on what I’m up to and working on
- remote work at home or on the road
- podcasting, WordPress, and community, both offline and on.
- Galicia’s history, cultural heritage, geography, and relationship to Spain
- spirituality: particularly “heterodox” Islam, perennial philosophy, entheogens, Sufism, belief, [conversion](https://amongthestones.com/journal/the-reformation-within-myself-will-not-be-televised/), and being [skeptical](https://amongthestones.com/journal/quran-and-coherent-heterodoxy-a-book-and-system-beyond-religion/) of religious orthodoxies
- posts and photos of my time in Upper Guinea and [West African](https://amongthestones.com/tag/west-africa/) history
- interesting [links](https://amongthestones.com/links/) about anything
